## Overview

This project implements a real-time chess piece detection system using the YOLOv8 model. It processes live images of a chessboard to accurately identify and locate chess pieces, making it ideal for automated game analysis and interactive chess applications.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Processing:** Detects chess pieces from live video feeds or images.
- **Robust Detection:** Performs well under various lighting and board conditions.
- **Complete Workflow:** Involves data collection, model training, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLOv8** for object detection.
- **Python** as the primary programming language.
- **OpenCV** for image processing.

## Outcome

The project demonstrates a strong command of computer vision and machine learning, achieving high accuracy in detecting chess pieces in real time.
